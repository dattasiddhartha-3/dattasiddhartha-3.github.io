Publications

DeepObfusCode: Source Code Obfuscation Through Sequence-to-Sequence Networks
arXiv
The paper explores a novel methodology in source code obfuscation through the application of text-based recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder models in ciphertext generation and key generation. Sequence-to-sequence models are incorporated into the model architecture to generate obfuscated code, generate the deobfuscation key, and live execution. Quantitative benchmark comparison to existing obfuscation methods indicate significant improvement in stealth and execution cost for the proposed solution, and experiments regarding the model's properties yield positive results regarding its character variation, dissimilarity to the original codebase, and consistent length of obfuscated code.

HAIV: Computational Precision Medicine against HIV Drug Resistance
Feb 23 2018
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is currently a non-curable yet treatable virus. The virus replicates by encoding its own DNA into white blood cells, and the virus prevents white blood cells from protecting the body from other diseases, thus causing immunological failure. The most effective treatment currently in use is antiretroviral therapy (ART) (commonly known as “cocktail therapy”), which involves prescribing to the patient a combination of drugs that have a high likelihood of inhibiting HIV replication. 
In brief, the solution is to forecast the development of HIV from strain to strain, by predicting the mutations it undergoes, which will help us apply the right drug at the right time.  In more detail, we have an algorithmic methodology to predict behavior of HIV in the human body with respect to current, historical, and future conditions of the virus, and with respect to the human body conditions and medication applied over time. The second stage is to build the machine that automatically detects HIV strain types, and applies the medication. The longer term goal from this solution is to lay a foundation in precision medicine, in particular for anti-drug-resistant viral medication treatment.  To summarize, this paper aims to put the AI in HIV.
