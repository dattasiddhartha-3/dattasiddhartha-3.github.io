Winner of Cal Hacks 5.0 (Epson Sponsor Award)

Using Epson's revolutionary augmented reality Moverio glasses and Google's speech to text API we have created a great tool for patients with Alzheimers disease. Our software uses state of the art object detection and Moverio's gps system to keep track of a where you have left your items. When an item is lost, the glasses can be put into a second mode where they will notify you of when and where you last saw the item, as well as an image of where you last saw them. Then it will use object detection to help you find the item, highlighting any objects which are similar to the one you are looking for.
