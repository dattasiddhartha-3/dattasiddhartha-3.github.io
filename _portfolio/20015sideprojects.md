### Structural Balance within International Relation Networks

* Calculated structural balance within network graphs of alliances and rivalries between nations from 1800 to 1945

* Tested for conflict correlations, correlations to war, network theory consistency, and more

* Constructed reinforcement learning algorithm for edge weight calculation for multivariate structural balance calculation
