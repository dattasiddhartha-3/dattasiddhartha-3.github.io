The backstory of the project started off in my freshman year when my close friend got dumped by his girlfriend right before his final exams, and his GPA dropped from 3.7 to 2.7. It made me realize that even someone as intelligent as my friend could be vulnerable to the emotional dangers of romance. So I set out to figure out a way to help him recover. He did not want to talk about his situation with anyone and wanted to save "face", so I figured he could speak with a very smart bot.
