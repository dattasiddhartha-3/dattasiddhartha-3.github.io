Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is currently a non-curable yet treatable virus. The virus replicates by encoding its own DNA into white blood cells, and the virus prevents white blood cells from protecting the body from other diseases, thus causing immunological failure. The most effective treatment currently in use is antiretroviral therapy (ART) (commonly known as “cocktail therapy”), which involves prescribing to the patient a combination of drugs that have a high likelihood of inhibiting HIV replication. 

In brief, the solution is to forecast the development of HIV from strain to strain, by predicting the mutations it undergoes, which will help us apply the right drug at the right time. In more detail, we have an algorithmic methodology to predict behavior of HIV in the human body with respect to current, historical, and future conditions of the virus, and with respect to the human body conditions and medication applied over time. The second stage is to build the machine that automatically detects HIV strain types, and applies the medication. The longer term goal from this solution is to lay a foundation in precision medicine, in particular for anti-drug-resistant viral medication treatment. To summarize, this paper aims to put the AI in HIV.
