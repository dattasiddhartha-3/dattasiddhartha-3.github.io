    > Client inferencing engine built for an investment bank; maps out traders to stocks with 70+ markets/cognitive features to interpolate trade execution motifs \n

    > Network graph between clients and stocks: client-client edges were weighted functions of client-specific properties (e.g. fund type); stock-stock edges on stock-specific properties (e.g. sector, average daily volume); client-stock edges on behavioural/decision-making/trading features (e.g. likelihood of traded with volatility, risk aversity relative to news, momentum/contrarian, preferences for certain sectors, regret minimization, confidence bias) \n

   > Edge weight matrices were calculated using reinforcement learning based on historical trades taken by each client on each stock \n

   > Output was the identification of cognitive decision-making motifs adopted by each individual trader relative to other traders, and even able to identify successful situation-specific motifs based on the cumulative profit made by those cognitive motifs (i.e. clustered different decision-making motifs to specific scenarios/environments) \n

   > Back-testing indicated ~7x% accuracy in predicting client execution on any given day (accuracy rising exponentially as time horizon increases to 2 weeks); successfully captured value-based decision-making cognition of rational agents

### Siddhartha Datta

Currently a DPhil in Computer Science candidate at the University of Oxford funded by the Rhodes Scholarship. I completed my BBA in Global Business in Hong Kong, worked with a few investment banks, developed an interest in machine learning, and look forward to testing today's waters for the future.
