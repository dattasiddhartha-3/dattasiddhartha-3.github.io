  <small>Blackbox attack models used to put focus on querying labels of their victim’s model by passing in inputs, and training attack algorithms based on fooled labels. Our initial (and proven) hypothesis is that there is no real need for an attacker to be able to interact with the victim model and should be able to perform a successful “blind” blackbox attack model. Thus we varied different configurations of attack, including domain similarity, different attack algorithms, different model architectures, etc. What we found was that we can leverage domain adaptation to execute a successful blind blackbox attack on text classification models.</small>

  <summary><b><small>S. Datta. 2019. Submitted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01837">DeepObfusCode: Source Code Obfuscation Through Sequence-to-Sequence Networks</a> In ICASSP 2020</small></b></summary>

  <small>The paper explores a novel methodology in source code obfuscation through the application of text-based recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder models in ciphertext generation and key generation. Sequence-to-sequence models are incorporated into the model architecture to generate obfuscated code, generate the deobfuscation key, and live execution. Quantitative benchmark comparison to existing obfuscation methods indicate significant improvement in stealth and execution cost for the proposed solution, and experiments regarding the model's properties yield positive results regarding its character variation, dissimilarity to the original codebase, and consistent length of obfuscated code.</small>

  <small>This research aims to explore the underlying relational dynamics between people on freelance work platforms, between employers and employees, and within employees themselves. Particular interest will be placed on gender correlations and the objective to locate the most important variables involved in reasonable pay, as the aim of the study is to identify biases on the platform. Data was scraped from the work platform for all the possible variables available, from tests taken, to work histories, to skills listed, to even general personal descriptions.</small>

"Predicting Value-based Decision-making using Time Series neural ECoG data" In Data-X 2018 </small></b></summary>  <a href="https://github.com/dattasiddhartha/DataX-NeuralDecisionMaking">[code]</a>  <a href="https://data-x.blog/projects/predicting-gambling-decisions/">[poster]</a>  <a href="https://crcns.org/data-sets/ofc/ofc-3/about-ofc-2">[data]</a>  <a href="https://github.com/dattasiddhartha/neurocogpy">[library]</a>

<small>A project focused on predicting gambling decisions from brainwave electrocorticography (ECoG) data. The motivation behind this project was based on societal implications such as applications to law and regulation of the gambling industry, clinical practice in understanding how neurodegenerative disease or trauma affect decision making, and to some extent even our understanding of free will. The project utilized data recorded by the Knight Lab, a neuroscience lab at UC Berkeley. The ECoG data was collected from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of epileptic patients, who volunteered to participate in research while undergoing intracranial monitoring for surgical planning purposes. Patients were given a task of playing a game in which they could choose either ‘Gamble’ or ‘Safebet’ for 200 trials. Over the course of the semester, we pre-processed, explored, and modeled the data, with the ultimate goal of predicting whether a patient would gamble or not given only the ECoG data, recorded before the patient indicated their decision by a button press. Much exploration was on feature engineering, as there are not many established feature engineering methods in the analysis of ECoG data: examples of features include using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile values and number of peaks for electrode data in a patient’s trial. Modeling was done through logistic regression, random forest, adaboost, naive bayes, neural nets, and perceptron. Logistic regression fared the best, with one model giving a 10% boost over the baseline accuracy found with Naive Bayes. This result demonstrates that there is information in the OFC neural signal, which can be used to predict decisions before they are made overtly.</small>

  <small>This paper introduces a novel methodology to treat HIV through the combination of existing antiretroviral therapy with mutation prediction algorithm (“HAIV”). The algorithm developed predicts the next possible mutations that a given HIV strain may undergo, and implies doctors can apply the right medication at the right time, hence alleviating the need to apply more variations of medication
than needed, further suppressing the possibility for drug resistance. The work is deemed to be novel and without any prior work in the industry thus far, and the applications range from any task requiring the prediction of mutations, or any virus dealing with drug resistance.</small>

  <summary><b><small> S. Datta, S.L. Nam 2017. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=142kTVrKNGH42splekvbfXGVtT9HhNQPq">BreakupBot: An Artificial Intelligence Therapeutic Chatbot Conducting Empathetic Counselling via Heartrate Sentimental Analysis</a> In President's Cup 2016-17 (Finalist) </small></b></summary>

  <small>BreakupBot is the title of a chatbot platform that aids people to recover from their romantic breakups. To cater to a heterogeneous audience, there will be several therapy mechanisms in place to ensure every type of lover will be catered to. Some users may wish to think deeply about relationships, while some may need to gain maturity about love in general; in either case, the AI behind the chatbot will personalize itself to the user, and adopt both psychological and philosophical counselling methodologies. Personalization ranges from understanding the user’s lover characteristics, analyzing the user’s stress levels via heartrate, and responding instantaneously to their every query and woe. The technology is adept and fitting for complementing the bot: other than the artificial intelligence system that collects information to share with the user and personalizes it to the user’s taste, the bot features accurate heartrate analysis available to most smartphones via camera-detection. Such a mechanism will aid the bot in empathizing with the user, contrary to other bots who attempt facial recognition or process speech patterns. Moreover, this project merely represents the beginning of further exploration into psychological therapeutic benefits via AI. Once the BreakupBot penetrates the market wide enough to allow entry to other similar products, other therapeutic bots and mechanisms can be designed to streamline human being’s complicated lives and emotions. This project is a goldmine, with respect to the fact that it creates its own category of products: it is not in the personal assistant AI category, but the currently underdeveloped therapy AI category, hence there is a lot of potential for research and profit. At the end of the day, the value of this project is not only its intrinsic research, or its mechanisms, or its cross-departmental field of study; its value comes from robots attempting to solve the problems of human beings at a psychological level.</small>
