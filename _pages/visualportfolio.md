_Winning submisson at Cal Hacks 5.0; display goggles that helps Alzheimerâ€™s patients locate personal affects using object detection and speech recognition._

<details>
  <summary> Implementation</summary>
  
  (*) Trained Mask R-CNN object detection classifier on grayed-out ImageNet dataset to sustain realtime inference / classification rate at least 30fps; optimized setup of models (e.g. Yolo v1-3), datasets (e.g. MS Coco) on high-latency Android embedded system
  
  (*) Built Android application and custom scripts (for parsing and relaying camera input) and root-installed into Moverio augmented reality display googles to stream camera input, apply bounding boxes around objects to be detected, and output to display feed of device
  
  (*) Contributed an optimized low-latency embedded-system implementation that performs speech recognition, video streaming/display, image processing with minimal visible stutter

* BreakupBot is a therapeutic chatbot developed to help get over romantic breakups. Organically acquired 200+ users of varying demographics. The system, initially built to help people who could not get over breakups, uses scraped content from dating sites and builds a philosophical counselling knowledge graph as the decision tree for generating responses to user input.
