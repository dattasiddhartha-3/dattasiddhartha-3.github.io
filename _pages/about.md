    excerpt: "Winning submisson at Cal Hacks 5.0; display goggles that helps Alzheimerâ€™s patients locate personal affects using object detection and speech recognition.
    |>| Trained Mask R-CNN object detection classifier on grayed-out ImageNet dataset to sustain realtime inference / classification rate at least 30fps; optimized setup of models (e.g. Yolo v1-3), datasets (e.g. MS Coco) on high-latency Android embedded system
  |>| Built Android application and custom scripts (for parsing and relaying camera input) and root-installed into Moverio augmented reality display googles to stream camera input, apply bounding boxes around objects to be detected, and output to display feed of device
  
  |>| Contributed an optimized low-latency embedded-system implementation that performs speech recognition, video streaming/display, image processing with minimal visible stutter

    excerpt: "BreakupBot is a therapeutic chatbot developed to help get over romantic breakups. Organically acquired 200+ users of varying demographics. The system, initially built to help people who could not get over breakups, uses scraped content from dating sites and builds a philosophical counselling knowledge graph as the decision tree for generating responses to user input."

    excerpt: "The proposed and implemented system provides allows cloud computing companies to execute obfuscated code (non-plaintext source code), and allows clients to obfucate code through a seq2seq-based obfuscation network. Other than the applications of neural network archictectures in source code obfuscation, the paper released also introduces a quantitative framework to evaluate obfuscation methods."

    title: "Location Network Fingerprinting: Network Analysis of Franchise Expansion"
    excerpt: "After aggregating expansion data from sucessful franchises/chains from many industries (including fast food, supermarkets, coffee, ...), we developed network analysis algorithms that identified statistically-likely patterns or fingerprints of expansion success. Specifically, we found that certain succesful firms tended to expand in certain ways that consolidated their success. We found the results to be 98% statistically significant, and pitched the system as a service for firms intending to expand within the US but are strategically unsure how."
