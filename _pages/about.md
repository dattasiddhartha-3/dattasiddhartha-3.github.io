    excerpt: "After aggregating expansion data from sucessful franchises/chains from many industries (including fast food, supermarkets, coffee, ...), we developed network analysis algorithms that identified statistically-likely patterns or fingerprints of expansion success. Specifically, we found that certain succesful firms tended to expand in certain ways that consolidated their success. We found the results to be 98% statistically significant, and pitched the system as a service for firms intending to expand within the US but are strategically unsure how."

Three years ago I started my degree in Global Business at HKUST with the goal in mind that I will build a company and create value to the society that has given many opportunities. I have been taught different lessons from cofounding 2 startups, studying in 2 exchange institutions, researching with 3 labs, working for 8 different companies in 3 years, winning 11 hackathons, being awarded HK$ 110,000 in undergraduate scholarships per year, and maintaining a graduation GPA above 3.7 (expected first class honors). I have been able to validate my passion in building systems and solutions for the betterment of my family and community, and aspire to pursue doctoral studies in computational cognitive science. 

The objective of my study in computational cognitive science is to build cognitive models and algorithms and further design more effective machine learning architectures, following behind the works of Tom Griffiths, Josh Tenebaum and Brendan M. Lake. My aspiration in this field began when I was a freshman and built BreakupBot, an AI chatbot that helped romantic partners get over their breakups through philosophical counselling, and generating responses based on the emotional level of the user (proxied by their heartrate). The chatbot that now has 200+ users in the Philippines alone began with me want to solve a problem for someone in my community. My friend had fallen out of a relationship, had been depressed, but did not want to talk to anyone. Recognizing it was unhealthy, I wanted to help my friend, so I decided a “robot counsellor” might be the optimal solution. After failing to find computer science partners willing to develop an empathetic natural language processing system, I decided to self-learn programming. I studied the background papers on text generation, knowledge graphing (of content that scraped from love advisory sites), estimation of heartrate from the redness of a user’s finger (shine LED on finger, then take camera image), and built an Android app, I tested the prototype and iteratively designed my app for users who have gone through breakups, including my friend. I believe this experience in such a short span of time captures my determination to bring change to members of my community, ability to scale ideas and projects from nothing, and solve unstructured in a structured yet unconventional way.

Thankfully I believe I have been well-trained in preparation for study in this field. I have worked as a research assistant under Prof Mahesh Srinivasan at UC Berkeley’s Language and Children Development Lab, working on polysemous word tagging tools to identify how children associate different terms together. I have recently tested my ability to conduct independent research by publishing a paper in source code obfuscation, where I introduce a neural network architecture in obfuscating code, and further executing the obfuscated code, thus cloud computing companies as a use case would not be able to read confidential source code of clients. My experience in building mutation algorithms that predict consecutive strains of HIV in patient bloodstreams and optimizing antiretroviral treatment, and project with the Knight Lab at UC Berkeley where we built decision-making models based on neural ECoG data contributed to grounding my foundation in bioinformatics. Add on the 20+ deep learning projects I deployed for various companies, labs and hackathons, and achieving top grades in social network analysis, organizational behavior and decision-making coursework, I believe I have the holistic background needed to succeed in my field of study.
