### Siddhartha Datta

Thank you for venturing into my repository of project highlights, research experience, and looking glass into my personal life. While each page or section might go in-depth into a particular domain or problem or solution, the one thing that connects them all together is that each project I work on in some way *tests* the future of that domain, to test whether the solution is in this problem's path in the coming years/decades.
